Here's a description of my website using Markdown.

## About

An about page is common within websites and let's visitors know the details of the site.

- The focus of this exact site is solely to give me exposure to Markdown for the purpose of eventually creating a professional website
- My name is Jacob Bowman and I am the person who built this measely communication vehicle
- I am using Jekyll and Markdown through Github to do this, and thus far it is surprisingly easy
