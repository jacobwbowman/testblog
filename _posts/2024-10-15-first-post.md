This is the first paragraph of my first post - how exciting!
Below is me toying with markdown in juvenile ways:

## THIS RIGHT HERE IS A HEADING OF THE SECOND LARGEST VARIETY

I am now including text that is immediately followed by more text on a new line.
That means this text will be in a paragraph (I was told this by someone smarter than me).
I wonder if it will be indented.
Probably not unless I tell it to.
But guess what?
I don't know how to do that.
Perhaps I'll die never knowing.

I also have a hyperlink to [Google](https://www.bing.com).
Did you click on it? Lol it was not Google. Get Bing-ed, nerd.

Here's a bulleted list MIXED with a numbered list (assuming it'll work):
- bullet!
- bullet!
1. number?
2. number?
